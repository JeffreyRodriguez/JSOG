JavaScript Object Graph
=====================

The JSOG library makes working with JSON simple. While many JSON libraries are excellent for reading and writing JSON, working with JSON objects in memory can be cumbersome and verbose.

JSOG provides the developer with an easy way to read, write, and manipulate JSON objects. The Jackson JSON library provides serialization and deserialization support for JSOG.
